      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p> The Cat's Brew was created by cat lover and coffee enthusiast, Elli Korn and her partner Michaela Petty. The idea came to them after listening to a friend lament they felt left out of most queer spaces as they typically centered around alcohol. After years of planning, The Cat's Brew grew into the inclusive, fun, and sober community space you see today.

        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>As we aim to bring communities together, The Cat's Brew has strived to implement accessible infrastructure since the business was in early concept stages.</p>
          
        <p>The entire cafe is wheelchair-accessible, with a ramp we made sure wasn't too steep (believe us, we did multiple
            tests prior to opening)! Additionally, The Cat's Brew has menus in braille available, as well as sign-language interpretors 
            available upon request. </p>
            
            <p>As for dietary restrictions, The Cat's Brew currently offers gluten-free, sugar-free and low-sodium options. Have a suggestion to make 
            our cafe more accessible? Shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:thecatsbrew@gmail.com">thecatsbrew@gmail.com!</a>
            </p>
        <h3>Inclusivity</h3>
        <p> The Cat's Brew strives to be an inclusive community space for the wide spectrum of the LGBTQ+. </p>
        <p>As a prinicple, all of our bathrooms were specifically designed to be gender-inclusive,
          and moreover, all of them come equipped with a diaper-change station and are fully stocked with free menstrual products. </p>
        <p>Most importantly, as we strive to serve the wide-spectrum of our community,
            The Cat's Brew has a strict anti-racist policy, and we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone in violation. </p>
        <p>Aside from our menu being offered in braille, we also have our menus translated in Spanish, French, Arabic, and Mandarin. Upon request, The Cat's Brew would also be more than happy to translate our menu into any language to add to our repository!
        <p>Additionally, The Cat's Brew offers Haram and Kosher options. And finally, as we know our patrons typically stay in our establishment for a good while, so we keep a reserve of prayer mats - let a staff member know if you'd like to use one! </p>
        </p>
        <h2>FAQS</h2>
        <h3>How does the adoption process work?</h3>
        <p>We partner with local shelters to find cats that would do best in our unique environment. As we work with shelters, we never want to place undue stress on any of our kitties, so we make sure to evaluate whether they can acclimate!</p>
        <h3>What shelters do you work with?</h3>
        <p>We partner with a multitude of shelters, but our most frequently worked with are the SPCA, the Dallas Animal Services, and Operation Kindness! </p>
        <h3>Are there dietary alternatives?</h3>
        <p>We're so glad you asked - we have dairy alternatives, gluten-free, sugar-free and low-sodium options available! Additionally, we also offer Haram and Kosher items. </p>
        <h3>What happens if a cat scratches/bites me?</h3>
        <p>The Cat's Brew will definitely provide first aid, but we accept no responsibilities beyond that. Please bear in mind this risk before visiting because while we do our best to make sure our kitties can adjust to the cafe, we do have cats with traumatic pasts that may be more reactive than others.</p>
        <h3>Is the café wheel-chairaccessible?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Most definitely! </p>
        <h3>What kinds of community events do you host?</h3>
        <p>All kinds! We host speed-cating events to help our LGBTQ+ members find love. We also partner with local charities, where all adoption fees are donated! </p>
        <h3>How can I organize a community event at The Cat’s Brew?</h3>
        <p>We'd love to hear your ideas! To suggest or organize a community event, please shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:thecatsbrew@gmail.com">thecatsbrew@gmail.com!</a> </p>
