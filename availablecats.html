          <p>Here comes Giggy! With her goofy legs, and floppy ears, what's not to love about this goofball? Sadly, Giggy's late owner passed away last year, but she's been relearning how to love. She would do best in a home with no dogs, but gets along with cats, people, and children just fine!</p>
