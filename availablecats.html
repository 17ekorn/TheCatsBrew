      <h2>Adoption Process</h2>
      <p>Considering adoption? The easiest way is to come on in and meet the cats that are available for adoption.
         You can see what cat has the personality that works best for you and your home. </p>
        <p>Once you find a cat, you can download our adoption application below, upload it here, and we will 
        will follow up with you. Once we've internally reviewed your adoption application, we’ll coordinate a time
         for you to come and complete the adoption process, which includes adoption and medical fees - all of which will be discussed beforehand!</p>

            <p>This bonded pair was found right outside our door! We would describe Pebble as the quirky, hyper type, while Stone is the stoic, teddy bear type of guy. Both of these boys love people and children, and have a great track history with dogs!</p>

            <p>Say hello to our firecracker of a kitty, Pepper! Most would say Pepper is talkative, bossy, and affectionate. Coming from a litter of stray kittens, Pepper has grown to be quite independent. She gets along well with people, but can get a little spicy with dogs & other cats. </p>

            <p>Staff have nick-named Norman ‘Sweetboy’ on account of the sheer amount of cuddletime this boy requires to stay happy. Norman loves children (kittens and babies alike), but gets a little nervous around dogs and other adult cats. ‘Sweetboy’ would love to meet you! </p>

            <p>Here comes Giggy! With her goofy legs, and floppy ears, what's not to love about this goofball? Sadly, Giggy's late owner passed away last year, but she's been relearning how to love. She would do best in a home with no dogs, but gets along with cats, people, and children just fine!</p>

            <h3>ICHABOD<Span> | <Span> </Span> 2 Year Olds</span></h3>
            <p>Known to most as our gentle giant, this little guy makes a great addition to any home looking for a sweet, shy furbaby. As a former stray, we believe our jumpy Ichabod would do best in a relaxed home with low activity. This 3-year-old kitty would love to find his comfortable forever home. </p>
